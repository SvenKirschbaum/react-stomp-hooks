## Install

```

## Usage

See also [the supplied example project](https://svenkirschbaum.github.io/react-stomp-hooks/), and [its sourcecode](example/src/App.js).

```jsx
import React from 'react'

import {
  StompSessionProvider,
  useSubscription,
} from "react-stomp-hooks";

const App = () => {
  return (
    //Initialize Stomp connection, will use SockJS for http(s) and WebSocket for ws(s)
    //The Connection can be used by all child components via the hooks or hocs.
    <StompSessionProvider
      url={"https://stream.elite12.de/api/sock"}
      //All options supported by @stomp/stompjs can be used here
    >
      <SubscribingComponent />
    </StompSessionProvider>
  );
};

function SubscribingComponent() {
  const [lastMessage, setLastMessage] = useState("No message received yet");

  //Subscribe to /topic/test, and use handler for all received messages
  //Note that all subscriptions made through the library are automatically removed when their owning component gets unmounted.
  //If the STOMP connection itself is lost they are however restored on reconnect.
  //You can also supply an array as the first parameter, which will subscribe to all destinations in the array
  useSubscription("/topic/test", (message) => setLastMessage(message.body));

  return (
    <div>Last Message: {lastMessage}</div>
  );
}
```
